Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ Sulaiman was written with a lot of synchronous code
    during the next fex build we should change as much code
    as possible to be asynchronous for the sake of performance

Testing: 
  ☐ downloading an extension (we changed the download script)

Features:
  ☐ rewrite the api.js script to be more recognized
  ✔ rewrite the index.js file @done(19-03-12 05:22)

  ✔ revamp the check-for-updates system to be more like dawayer @done(19-03-11 00:12)
  ✔ rewrite extensions download code to use the new script @done(19-03-11 05:40)
  
  ☐ installing extensions without reloading @next-build
  ☐ uninstalling extensions without reloading @next-build

  ☐ let extension require a part (API) of each other if a extension declare the usage of another extension in its package.json
    and the extension it require is installed and does have public API @next-build

  ☐ an app that is installed on the the user os can use sulaiman api to stream an extension to sulaiman,
    without installing an extension @next-build
  
UI/UX:
  ☐ try a pure black dark mode
  ✔ add phrase to show the changelog file if one exists and not empty @done(19-03-13 05:43)
  ✔ add option card to change the tray color @done(19-03-12 09:37)
  
  ☐ showing extensions credits @next-build

  ☐ show most recent phrases when input is empty, or most used @next-build

  ☐ show popular extensions from npm registry (gallery) @next-build
    ☐ have a section that shows popular extensions (popular all time)
    ☐ have a section that shows trending extensions (popular this week)
    ☐ have a section that shows extensions made by herp project (sort by popularity)
