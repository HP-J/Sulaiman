Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ loading extensions Async @research 
  ☐ remove the append new line feature (make it automatic) @research 

  ☐ At this point we have to rewrite the default theme
    it was supposed to be a few sample css files but it became
    so complicated and overwhelming to new extension developers how want to develop a theme @low 

Testing:
  ☐ Downloading, Installing, Deleting, Updating and Aborting Extensions @high 
  ☐ Search for Extensions @high 
  ☐ Extensions Gallery @high 

Features:
  ☐ refactor the api.js script to be more recognized @high 
  
  ☐ installing extensions without reloading @research
  ☐ uninstalling extensions without reloading @research

  ☐ let extension require a part (API) of each other if a extension declare the usage of another extension in its package.json
    the extension it requires is also to be installed with it @research

  ☐ an app that is installed on the the user OS can use sulaiman API to stream an extension to sulaiman,
    without installing an extension @research
  
UI/UX:
  ☐ try a pure black dark mode @low  
  
  ☐ showing extensions credits
  ☐ show most recent prefixes when input is empty, or most used... or both

  ☐ show popular extensions from the npm registry (gallery) @high 
    ☐ have a section that shows popular extensions (popular all time)
    ☐ have a section that shows trending extensions (popular this week)
    ☐ have a section that shows extensions made by herp project (sort by popularity)
    ☐ search for specific extensions from the npm registry
