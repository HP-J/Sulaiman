Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ At this point we have to rewrite the default theme
    it was supposed to be a few sample css files but it became
    so complicated and overwhelming to new extension developers how want to develop a theme @low 

Testing: 
  ☐ Downloading, Installing, Deleting, Updating and Aborting Extensions is all untested code (after the changes to the card API) @critical 
  ☐ move the 'Phrases' phrase to an argument of the 'Extensions' phrase
  ☐ downloading an extension package (after we changed the download script) @critical 

Features:
  ✔ combine the shortcut and the auto-launch together in the same card and give the user a walkthrough the builtin phrases @done(19-03-15 13:38)

  ☐ rewrite the api.js script to be more recognized @high 
  ✔ rewrite the index.js file @done(19-03-12 05:22)

  ✔ revamp the check-for-updates system to be more like dawayer @done(19-03-11 00:12)
  ✔ rewrite extensions download code to use the new script @done(19-03-11 05:40)
  
  ☐ installing extensions without reloading
  ☐ uninstalling extensions without reloading

  ☐ let extension require a part (API) of each other if a extension declare the usage of another extension in its package.json
    the extension it requires is also to be installed with it @research

  ☐ an app that is installed on the the user OS can use sulaiman API to stream an extension to sulaiman,
    without installing an extension @research
  
UI/UX:
  ☐ try a pure black dark mode @low  
  
  ✔ add phrase to show the changelog file if one exists and not empty @done(19-03-13 05:43)
