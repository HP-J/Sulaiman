{
  // when sulaiman (re)load the user will get a registry request
  // that will show him all the permissions you're asking for, if they
  // chosen to accept the request, your extension gets the permissions and modules you asked for,
  // then events will register their attached callbacks if any, then the callback function gets executed

  // @param { string } name the name of the extension

  // @param { [ 'fs.read', 'fs.write', 'window.body' ] } permissions
  // some modules like `fs` are divided to multiple subsets of functions,
  // in those cases, the module will be ignored if it was added in `require` and can only be
  // required in `permissions`.
  // example: `[ 'fs.read' ]` will give you access to the read functions only of the `fs` module,
  // you can also ask for permissions to use some global variables
  // example: `[ 'window.body' ]` you can find all the available permissions and what they do in our wiki

  // @param { [ '...' ] } modules here you can ask for permissions to use a full module, example: `[ 'electron', 'request' ]`
  // @param { { 'oninput': Function } } events a set of events that you can attach callback to,
  // you can find all the available events and when they are executed in our wiki

  // @param { () => {} } callback gets executed when the user accepts the registry object request
