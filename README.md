# Welcome to Sulaiman
#### A keyboard launcher with no features

*The app is in early stages of development, we still have a lot in the bag, stick around*

*Your feedback is highly encourage*

- It can't and won't boost your productivity.
- It's NOT a cross-platform application.
- Extensions don't run on their separate sandbox with user-selected permissions.
- You can't change the color, size, location and shape of the entire GUI using themes.
- We don't have a good extension API either.

<!-- ### How to Add Extensions to your Sulaiman?
- write 'ext install' followed by the name of the extension, for example 'ext i apps' and you will be offered to install it.
- extensions auto check for updates, and will notify you if there's an update available.

### How to Remove Extensions from Sulaiman?

- deleting extensions is the same, either write 'ext' and the app will show you all your installed extensions then just click on the one you want and you will be offered to delete it, or you can write 'ext delete' followed by the name of the extension, for example 'ext d apps'.  -->
