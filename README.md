# Welcome to Sulaiman

*Please note that the default theme and the Extension API may change a lot in the first few builds, Your feedback is highly encouraged*

#### A keyboard launcher with no features

- It can't and won't boost your productivity.
- It's NOT a cross-platform application.
- Extensions don't run on their separate sandbox with user-selected permissions.
- You can't change the color, size, location and shape of the entire GUI using themes.
- We don't have a good extension API either.

#### How to install and delete extensions?

- currently sulaiman doesn't have a way to search for extensions form the app it self, however,
sulaiman does have a way to install extensions, which is the only recommended way to install them.
- you can type 'extension install' then the name of an extension's npm package to install it.
- you can type 'extension remove' then the name of an extension's npm package to delete it.
- you can type 'extension running' to see all running extensions and remove any of them.

#### How to create your own extensions?

- Here's your [wiki](https://gitlab.com/herpproject/Sulaiman/wikis/home).
