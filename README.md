# Welcome to Sulaiman
#### Sulaiman is a keyboard launcher with no features

### => Sulaiman is in early stages of development, be aware that everything you see might be subjected to change, and so your feedback is highly encouraged <=

- It can't and won't boost your productivity.
- It's NOT a cross-platform application.
- You can't change the color, size, location and shape of the GUI using CSS themes.
- Extensions don't run on their separate sandbox with user-selected permissions.
- We don't have a good extension API either.

<!-- ### How to Add Extensions to your Sulaiman?
- write 'ext' followed by the name of the extension, for example 'apps' and you well be offered to add or remove the extension if you already had it.
- extensions auto-update themselves but you well be notified if an updated extension wants more or different permissions meanwhile it will be disabled.

### How to Create Extensions?

- the boilerplate
