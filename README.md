#### How to install and delete extensions?

- currently sulaiman doesn't have a way to search for extensions form the app it self, however,
sulaiman does have a way to install extensions, which is the only recommended way to install them.
- you can type 'extension install' then the name of an extension's npm package to install it.
- you can type 'extension remove' then the name of an extension's npm package to delete it.
- you can type 'extension running' to see all running extensions and remove any of them. -->

<!-- #### How to create your own extensions?
