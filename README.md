# Welcome to Sulaiman
#### A keyboard launcher with no features

### => Sulaiman is in early stages of development, be aware that everything is subjected to be changed, and feedback is highly encouraged <=

- It can't and won't boost your productivity.
- It's NOT a cross-platform application.
- You can't change the color, size, location and shape of the GUI using CSS themes.
- Extensions don't run on their separate sandbox with user-selected permissions.
- We don't have a good extension API either.

<!-- - The running apps on your system can't stream to sulaiman like normal extensions without actually having to manually install any extension. -->

<!-- ### How to Add Extensions to your Sulaiman?
- write 'ext' followed by the name of the extension, for example 'apps' and you well be offered to add or remove the extension if you already had it.
- extensions auto-update themselves but you well be notified if an updated extension wants more or different permissions meanwhile it will be disabled.

### How to Create Extensions?
- the wiki
- the boilerplate
- the node package -->

<!-- ### How to Connect to a Stream? (Coming Soon)
- you will be offered to connect to a stream when you open sulaiman and the other app at the same time, any how if you choose to dismiss the offer you will be able to write 'streams' to see the available streams or disconnect from a stream you already connected to.

### How to Stream to Sulaiman? (Coming Soon)
- now streaming is nice, it allows you as a developer to show some info or add some fast actions, things that are normally not so easy to reach on your app or maybe you are some voice-chat app and want users to control the app when they are running a game in full-screen and want another way then using your awful broken overlay. -->
